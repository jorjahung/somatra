##Somatra
(Part 2 of Final Project)

We have created a personal dashboard as an example of what we can do with the [Soma API](https://github.com/jorjahung/Soma).

Using D3.js and Ruby, we have created graphs that analyzes blood test data and highlights the results that are out of range. In addition to this, we have a mood tracker and a bloodtest diary to help you see if there is any correlation between the two. To make the dashboard more interesting, we integrated the Moves API to track your daily activity and Wit for fancy voice input.
